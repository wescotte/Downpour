Downpour is a multiplayer Puyo Puyo game written by me (Eric Wescott) sometime around 2004...

I'm archiving this project on github for my own personal amusement and grant anybody the right to do anything they want with the source code or artwork royalty free. 

Downpour is written in C++ using SDL, SDL_net, SDL_ttf

This build was originally compiled using DEV-CPP and SDL 1.2.6, SDL_net 1.2.5, and SDL_ttf 2.0.6

The font "times.ttf" was originally Windows Times New Roman but I assumed I couldn't simply include that in this package.

I found a font released undr the SIL Open Font License and renamed it to "times.ttf" to include in this package. It originally was called "cmunbi.ttf" 

and the README.txt included with that font package was the following:

This package was compiled by Christian Perfect (http://checkmyworking.com) from the Computer Modern Unicode fonts created by Andrey V. Panov (http://cm-unicode.sourceforge.net/)

They're released under the SIL Open Font License. See OFL.txt and OFL-FAQ.txt for the terms.

A demo page for these fonts was at http://www.checkmyworking.com/cm-web-fonts/ when I released them. I can only apologise, citizen of the future, if that address doesn't exist any more.
